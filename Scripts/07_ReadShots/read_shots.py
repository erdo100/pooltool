def extract_tracking_data_from_file(filename):
    """
    Extracts billiard shot tracking data from a single JSON file.

    For each shot (Entry) in every set, this function extracts the tracking data.
    It checks if tracking data exists, converts DeltaT_500us to seconds (500 Âµs = 0.0005 s),
    and converts the time, x, and y lists into NumPy arrays.

    The result for each shot is stored with:
        - "shotID": the shot ID.
        - "balls": a dict mapping each ball's index to its data arrays ("t", "x", and "y").
        - "filename": the name of the file from which the shot was extracted.

    Parameters:
        filename (str): The path to the JSON file.

    Returns:
        list: A list of dictionaries, one per shot.
